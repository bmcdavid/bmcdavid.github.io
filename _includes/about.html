<p>I am a proud father of two awesome daughters, with an amazing better-half. We live in a tiny, peaceful town in north-eastern Kentucky, which is sadly technology poor; but I do enjoy the remote commute to <a href="https://thestudioc.org/">StudioC</a>, located in Phoenix, AZ.</p>
<p>I strive to always improve and learn new things, many times through failures. I love to code and write useful tools that are customizable through the use of inversion of control and dependency injection; also, I really enjoy learning and using all the great things happening in DevOps like continuous delivery and cloud platforms, such as Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services.</p>
