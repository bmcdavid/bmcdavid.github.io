Every journey must start somewhere, and this blog is a start of a personal journey for me to share more, mostly code and tech, but other topics as well. I hope to grow as a writer during this process, which has been a struggle of mine while also helping others along the way.

I could've made life easy on myself and just used an online service to blog. Instead, I've chosen to create my own using Github Pages and Jekyll. Perhaps one day I'll move on to [ASP.Net Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/) to get more exposure to it since my day job primarily focuses on content management systems (CMS) using the older ASP.Net Framework.

Finally, as my oldest girl says every morning I take her to school as we open the garage door, Hello, World!
