Every journey must start somewhere and this blog is a start of a personal journey for me to share more. Most topics will be coding or technology related but other topics may come up as well. My hope is this blog will greatly improve my writing skills, which has been a struggle of mine. The added benefit of helping others along the way also makes me happy.

I could've made life easy on myself and just used an online service to blog. Instead, I've chosen to create my own using Github Pages and Jekyll. Perhaps one day I'll move on to [ASP.Net Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/) to get more exposure to it since my day job primarily focuses on content management systems (CMS) using the older ASP.Net Framework.

Finally, as my oldest girl says every morning I take her to school as we open the garage door, Hello, World!
